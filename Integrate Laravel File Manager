step
1# download unisharp file manager repo through composer

2# add service providers and aliases
3# publish vendor files
4# change lfm config file in the app config folder.
5# create a symbolic link between app storage and public folder.
if lfm.php Isn't there you have to publish the package again.

6# in the lfm config file change middlware to your custom guard by
changing auth property. add a colon after auth and specify Guard. 

Now you should point ckeditor to lfm when you initialize the editor through js.


all done now you should be good to go!
Remember lfm uses authentication  middleware so you have to be logged in
to use it.
